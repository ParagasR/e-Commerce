<h2 id='description'>Description</h2>

This is a backend application that implaments the use of an API client. Managing a database by using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests will allow the user to manipulate the data stored on the backend.
This application comes with seeds to test out the database, but will allow the user to create their own database of products. Each separated by category, product, and tag.
